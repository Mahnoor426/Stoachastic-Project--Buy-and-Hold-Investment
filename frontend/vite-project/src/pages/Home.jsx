          <p className="para_MonteCarlo">
            Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational technique used to estimate
            the behavior of complex systems and understand the impact of risk
            and uncertainty in prediction models. It involves generating a large
            number of random samples from probability distributions of uncertain
            variables. These random samples are used to run multiple
            simulations, often thousands or more, to observe a range of possible
            outcomes. By analyzing these outcomes, it provides a probabilistic
            understanding of the models behavior, offering insights into the
            likelihood of different results and helping to make informed
            decisions. This method is widely used in fields such as finance,
            engineering, supply chain management, and project management to
            model the effects of uncertainty and variability.

              In our project, we explore the dynamic world of asset price
              simulation through the implementation of three advanced Monte
              Carlo models based on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Each model
              offers a unique approach to simulating asset price paths,
              providing a comprehensive understanding of market behavior. By
              utilizing stochastic differential equations, pre-generated random
              values, and closed-form solutions, these models allow us to
              capture the intricate interplay of drift, volatility, and
              randomness inherent in financial markets. Through these
              simulations, we aim to enhance our predictive capabilities and
              gain deeper insights into asset price dynamics.
